# Aaron Weissman's Portfolio Site

This site was built using react as a way to show off other works of mine the leverage more technologies and skills. For styling I used styled-components, but everything on this site was hand tooled by me with minimal libraries in place.

To see it live, please visit [https://aaronweissman.com](https://aaronweissman.com). The site is hosted on AWS Route53 and stored on an AWS S3 bucket. I am utilizing AWS CloudFront distribution to speed up delivery and to access the SSL certificate.

The site is built using React Hooks for the components and Dark Mode was implemented using the React Context API in conjunction with Local Storage so that your settings persist.

Thanks for visiting!
