# Aaron Weissman's Portfolio Site

This site was built using react as a way to show off other works of mine the leverage more technologies and skills. For styling is used styled-components, but everything on this site was hand tooled by me with minimal libraries in place.

To see it live, please visit [www.aaronweissman.com](www.aaronweissman.com). The site was deployed using an AWS S3 bucket.

Thanks for visiting!
